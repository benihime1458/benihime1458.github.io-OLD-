        Hey, my name is Benny and I like avocado shakes. I am also an aspiring
        Ruby on Rails developer. I began teaching myself general web development
        a few months ago on and off but diving into the world of RoR was when my
        urgency to become a competent coder skyrocketed. Since then I had my
        share of hand-holding RoR tutorials but now is the time to make projects
        of my own, hence the creation of this portfolio site. I will be
        constantly polishing this project. Stick around to see my coding
        prospects progress.
